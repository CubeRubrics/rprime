        Hello fellow cubers! My name is Crystal, and I've been collecting and  
        solving cubes for 15 years. I learned from a combination of a Rubik's 
        brand pamphlet and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@badmephisto">badmephisto's YouTube channel</a>. 
        I always thought he had a great method of showing "triggers" in 
        different colors to help break down algorithms into understandable 
        and repeatable pieces. Since then, I've watched an 
        <a href="https://speedcubedb.com/">incredible</a>
        <a href="https://reco.nz/solve/index">wealth</a>
        of 
        <a href="https://cubedb.net">resources</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">community</a> 
        grow on the internet. However, I feel like 
        the resources are a little disconnected and can be hard to find. Or 
        you find yourself on forums asking questions others have asked a 
        thousand times already.

        This is an announcement that I am developing a new Cubing site with 
        some guy named Patrick. We want our site to be your homepage for all 
        your Rotational Polyhedron needs. Learn new methods, see comparisons from
        similar cube states, track stats and study reconstructions like never before.
        </p>

        I'm really excited to finally give back to the community I have loved 
        for half my life. I'm going to my first competition in Salem Oregon 
        this week, so I just want to say thank you if you're checking this out 
        because I met you there.
