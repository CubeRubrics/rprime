        Hello fellow cubers! My name is Crystal, and I've been collecting and  
        solving cubes for 15 years. I learned from a combination of a Rubik's 
        brand pamphlet and YouTube videos by a user called badmephisto. I 
        always thought he had a great method of showing "triggers" in 
        different colors to help break down algorithms into understandable 
        and repeatable pieces. Since then, I've watched an incredible wealth 
        of resources and community grow on the internet. However, I feel like 
        the resources are a little disconnected and can be hard to find. Or 
        you find yourself on forums asking questions others have asked a 
        thousand times already.

        This is an announcement that I am developing a new Cubing site with my 
        acquaintance Patrick. We want our site to be your homepage for all 
        things Cubing. Learn any method for any puzzle, practice with a timer 
        that tracks your stats, and reconstruct your solves with a never before 
        seen algorithm suggesting tool! If we don't have it, we want to at 
        least help find the site that does.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
        I have a few ideas that I've never seen done in practice, but in these 
        early days we would also love to have your feature requests and 
        feedback. Would you like a fully designed solve timer, or would you 
        prefer integration with another timer site? Is there a feature on a 
        site you want to make sure we replicate (or don't)? Or maybe you have 
        a recommendation for a source of algorithms we don't know about yet.
        </p>

        I'm really excited to finally give back to the community I have loved 
        for half my life. I'm going to my first competition in Salem Oregon 
        this week, so I just want to say thank you if you're checking this out 
        because I met you there.
