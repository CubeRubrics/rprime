Hello fellow cubers! My name is Crystal, and I've been collecting and  solving cubes for 15 years. 
I learned from a combination of a Rubik's brand pamphlet and [badmephisto on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@badmephisto).
I always thought he had a great method of showing "triggers" in different colors to help break down algorithms into understandable and repeatable pieces. 
Since then, I've watched an incredible 
[wealth](https://reco.nz/solve/index) of 
[resources](https://cubedb.net) and 
[community](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) 
grow on the internet. 
However, I feel like the resources are a little disconnected and can be hard to find. Or you find yourself on forums asking questions others have asked a thousand times already.

This is an announcement that I am developing a new Cubing site with my friend Patrick. We want our site to be your homepage for all things Cubing. Learn any method for any puzzle, practice with a timer that tracks your stats, and reconstruct your solves with a never before seen algorithm suggesting tool! If we don't have it, we want to at least help find the site that does.

I have a few ideas that I've never seen done in practice, but in these early days we would also love to have your [feature requests and feedback](mailto:team@cuberubrics.org). Would you like a fully designed solve timer, or would you prefer integration with another timer site? Is there a feature on a site you want to make sure we replicate (or don't)? Or maybe you have a recommendation for a source of algorithms we don't know about yet.

I'm really excited to finally give back to the community I have loved for half my life. I'm going to my first competition in 
[Salem, Oregon](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/SalemSpooktacular2023)
this week (October 25th, 2023), so I just want to say thank you if you're checking this out because I met you there.
